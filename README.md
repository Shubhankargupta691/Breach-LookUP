# **BreachLookUp**

**BreachLookUp** is an advanced security tool designed to identify compromised data, detect potential threats, and help users safeguard their digital assets. By scanning a variety of elements—including files, IP addresses, and domains—it provides users with a comprehensive assessment of their exposure to data breaches and cyber threats.

## **Key Features**

1. **File Integrity & Malware Detection**  
   Scans files by generating hashes (MD5, SHA256) and cross-referencing them with threat databases like VirusTotal to detect malicious or altered files. The tool also performs behavioral analysis on suspicious files to assess their potential risk.

2. **IP & Domain Reputation Analysis**  
   Monitors IP addresses and domains for any association with cybercriminal activities such as phishing, botnets, and fraud. This analysis helps you assess whether your network assets are tied to malicious activities.

3. **Hash Verification**  
   Verifies the integrity of files by cross-referencing hashes against trusted security databases to ensure they haven’t been tampered with or altered. This step adds an extra layer of security, confirming the legitimacy of files before they are opened or executed.

4. **Comprehensive Reporting**  
   After scanning, **BreachLookUp** generates a detailed, easy-to-read report on any identified risks, including flagged files, suspicious IP addresses, and domains. The report includes actionable recommendations on how to mitigate threats, helping you make informed security decisions.

## **How It Works**

1. **File Scanning**  
   - Upload or specify the files you want to check.
   - **BreachLookUp** computes their hashes and checks them against known threat databases.
   - Files are analyzed for malware using behavioral patterns and heuristic techniques.
   
2. **IP & Domain Reputation Check**  
   - Provide IP addresses or domains for evaluation.
   - **BreachLookUp** checks their status against global reputation databases for any malicious activity.

3. **Generate Reports**  
   - After scanning, the tool provides a comprehensive report on the status of each element (file, IP, domain) checked.
   - Receive recommendations to secure your system based on the findings.
